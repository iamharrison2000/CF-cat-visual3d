EQVIEW3D  ---   Shell scripts to generate Javascript applet 
for viewing earthquake locations in 3D via a web browser.

By: Felix Waldhauser (LDEO), Bob Simpson (USGS), Eric Malikowski (LDEO)

April 2016.

Edit top of file eqview3D.sh to set parameters, then run 
./eqview3D.sh

Earthquake file should be in hypoDD.reloc format.
Reads fault file in ASCII format if provided (lat, long).

All files are read in from and written out to the same 
directory from which eqview3D.sh is started.

To view results, point your browser to the file that ends 
with *.3d.html (e.g., your_project_name.3d.html). Make sure 
the file is in the same direcotry that contains the ./js 
directory.

Adjust parameters in eqview3D.sh so that all events are 
within box (xlim, zlim) and box fits the gray panel on the 
web site (cameraposition). You may need to empty the 
browser's cache or restart the brower before opening the 
new html file for the new parameters to take effect.

Follow viewing instructions given on the web site.

Important Notes for Mac Users
If you directly open 3d.html/#Project_name#.3d.html in your browser, you may encounter a Cross-Origin Request error (XMLHttpRequest cannot load file). This happens because browsers block local file requests for security reasons. You can see this error in the DevTools console (Option + Command + I).

To resolve this, I referred to this Stack Overflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20041656/xmlhttprequest-cannot-load-file-cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-ht 

Additionally, .jvd and .jvx files may have the wrong MIME type (application/octet-stream). We need to ensure their MIME type is set to text/xml.

Solution: Using a Local Python Server
To avoid these issues, set up a local Python server:

Run the shell script: 
1. Edit parameters in eqview3D.sh and execute it with "bash ./eqview3D.sh".
2. Start the Python server: Use "python3 ./custom_http_server.py". The server runs on port 8020 by default, but you can change this in the script.
3. Open the HTML file: Access it via "http://127.0.0.1:8020/#PROJECT_HTML_FILE#" in your browser.
This setup ensures proper loading and viewing of your 3D plot.

For this project: 
'CF.cat':tomoDD relocated file
'faults.dat': empty file
For visualization, we only select events with a magnitude larger than 0.5 and events with a magnitude larger than 2.7, which are colored red. To view the 3d interactive plot, please follow the steps above and open the URL: 'http://127.0.0.1:8020/CF.3d.html'
